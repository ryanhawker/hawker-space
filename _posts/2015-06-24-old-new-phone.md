I got a new phone. Its a nexus 5 whichbis a phone that came out in 2013. As an upgrade from the iPhone 4 (which doesn't even run iOS 8) it's phenomenal. Time eill reveal whether I regret leaving apple but I don't see that happening especially as my worl environment has only moved further and further into the Linux world.
