People say you need a good work/life balance. I don't want it to be a balance though, I want it to be mostly life! I want work to be a part of my life that I enjoy, and then I want to have things outside of work that I enjoy even more! 

This long weekend just passed I had some great adventures, I went on a walk to a secret beach with my family. My brother and I went diving around the rocks and found fish and little pockets of Paua. See below for awesome selfies and underwater pro-shots.

Anyway my point is that it was great, and coming back to work today facing an incredible work-load here I am, sitting in the near-by cafe thinking, "How can I make this week enjoyable.", what can I do each day so that I get home and think to myself, "That was a great day of work, I got lots done and I really enjoyed it". I think the answer to that question is __mindset__. All about the mindset. I think that if I go in to work enthusiastic, ready to get things done then I'm more likely to enjoy the day and actually get things done! It sounds stupid but it's so easy to get down on working.. mah mah too much work, not enough time yada yada. But if I just commit to doing this amount of work in a day, smashing it out as fast as I can and then going "WOO! Nailed it! I'm out of here" Then that could be great!

I'm going to give it a try. And I'm going to keep up this streak of running/adventuring around outside as well because it's making me feel awesome.
