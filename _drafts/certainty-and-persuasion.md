Research has shown that a person who is certain of their opinion about a product or company is more likely to buy, buy sooner, and spend more.
They are more willing to recommend the products or company and are more apt to resisting challenges to these beliefs. The obvious questions is
how can companies make the most of this? 

This post references the article "How Certainty Transforms Persuasions" authored by Zakary L. Tormala and Derek D. Rucker from the September 2015
Havard Business Review. A lot of information is taken directly from there but I want to write this post to try and discuss how the information
relates to me and the business I am in personally.

According to this collation of research (see these three extremely relevant papers, there are many more:
[1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740813000594), [2](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/92/1/30/),
[3](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2002-08203-005).) there are four "levers" that can be used to increase certainty.

They are:
- Consensus (perceiving that others share your opinion)
- Repetition (expressing a position many times)
- Ease (how readily an idea comes to mind)
- Defense (standing up for your beliefs)

Lets dive into each of these separately.

Consensus
=========

This one should be pretty obvious, most people are actually sheeple. We like to follow the crowd. It turns out that it is not just the case that we
want to do what others are doing, but we are also _more certain_ about our opinions when we know others share them. In our company the problem
we have on this front is that we are not in the business of mass production.. If loads of people had our products then yes maybe gathering 
their opinions to try and help potential customers feel some form of consensus would work I am sure. But maybe it only takes a few? I would be interested
in seeing just _how much_ consensus it takes to boost your confidence. Does it take just one person agreeing with you? Three? Ten? 

We can throw this out there without the help of others as well.. If a potential customers says something like "I can see how this will be really useful"
we can respond in kind with "We hear that a lot" or "Most people I show this to say similar sorts of things". This just reinforces to the potential 
customer that yes, your opinion is not only valid but there are others out there who feel the same way.
