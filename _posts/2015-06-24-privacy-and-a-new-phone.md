I got a new phone. Its a nexus 5 which is a phone that came out in 2013 which runs stock Android and is thus a bit of a Google flagship. As an upgrade from the iPhone 4 (which doesn't even run iOS 8) it's phenomenal. Time will reveal whether I regret leaving apple but I don't see that happening especially as my work environment has only moved further and further into the Linux world anyway.

One thing I really like is the fact that Google knows literally everything about me. And when I say that I like that I mean that it freaks me the hell out but I'm ok with it because of the benefits I receive.. Google reads all my messages whether they be email or text (or what ever else) and in doing so it has gotten to know me..

After a couple of weeks Google knows where my place of work is, where my home is, when all of my flights are, what stocks I have, the fact that I'm learning French and the list goes on.. I didn't have to tell Google any of these things. It found out on its own.

Now surely, I can't be the only person who is slightly freaked out by all this.. Privacy? What's that? When I first turned this phone on I started reading some terms and conditions and thought, "What the heck, I'm here now so may as well go for the full immersion", but I didn't realise how deep it would go.. and it is _**awesome**_ but where does it stop if ever? For people who like the "nothing to hide, nothing to fear" argument this should be the most fantastic thing ever but I don't agree with that argument. I'm not worried about them having bad information on me. I'm worried about the fact that if I wanted to hide something, no matter how small it is or relevant, I couldn't hide it. I can't think of anyway in which I could do that anymore. I probably couldn't before but now with this phone I'm almost sure that I couldn't. This is what freaks me out. I know they say it is about security vs. privacy and that sounds great, but what I feel it is more importantly about is freedom vs. control.
