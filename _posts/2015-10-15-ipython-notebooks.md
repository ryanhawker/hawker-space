## IPython Notebooks
I just want to say that using these things for research is a whole new world. I am now able to just mind dump code, equations, pictures and words all in one place and it actually comes out semi cohesive? I love that you can just start up a new cell and dump thoughts into it. Move cells around to put them in a more logical order. It really is like a notebook.

My next project for this website is to turn all of my posts into IPython Notebooks. There are a few tutorials around so I'll likely just follow one of those and hopefully write something up about the experience as I go (maybe even using a notebook! Huzzah!)

So stay tuned for that all you website crawlers that chance apon my website! Because I know there aren't any real people out there...
