I decided to start tweet haiku myself, as a way to get my thoughts out of my head and process some things going on in my life and it is actually quite nice. I enjoy coming up with a little something something every now and then that concisely reveals how I'm feeling or what I'm thinking.. and then I got this idea. 

What about a haiku tweeting bot? It's not that original.. they already exist all over twitter that's for sure. I wanted to do it for myself anyway because it sounds like a fun little thing to do. so is there a way I could make it a little bit original? Well... I think I've got a good idea.

What I want my haiku bot to do is take in a list of users, and strip their tweets for sentences that match the 5-7-5 syllable rule for haiku. It then builds a haiku from these and tweets it away. By doing this I hope to get some interesting results... like maybe I feed in Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders and see what weird haiku come out of that? 

In this post I'm going to break down the problem and solve it step by step. Looks like a lot of the problems have been solved before anyway but I'll still try to dive into each of them at least a little bit for my own benefit.

UPDATE:
Oh my goodness it's great and and so stupid but I love it. I'm so happy. Check it out at [@HaikuSecurity](https://twitter.com/HaikuSecurity).
