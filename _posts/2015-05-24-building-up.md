Yesterday I was working on this very website and I came to a stopping point. I wanted to do something that sounded rather simple. The thing with
the web is that there are so many different ways that you can do one thing. I ended up looking into web components (polymer), AngularJS, React and
JQuery and Liquid ways of doing the same simple thing.. and ways combining a few of those together. The thing is none of them made it sound simple.

So what did I decide to do? I decided that I'm going to do it in multiple different ways over time for the learning experience.

How can one decide what tool to use on a project if one does not know how to use the tools. As they say if all you have is a hammer, you're going to
break a lot of things..
