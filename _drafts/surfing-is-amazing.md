I have been trying to surf more recently and have really gotten back into it. The feeling of being in the ocean, surrounded by nature like that is amazing.. but the feeling of using natures power to gain speed, power through turns and just generally move around is incredible. You feel so in sync. Might be sounding like a bit of a hippy but who cares it's the truth. Doing something that requires natures prescence and power is something I think every human should experience.
