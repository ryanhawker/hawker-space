Sortable lists are not new, what I want to do is essentially take one users list of photos
and enable them to rank them such that the first in the list is their default picture and 
then the order after that is how they will appear in a "photo slideshow" of sorts.

To do this I'm using a ready made libray called [ng-sortable](https://github.com/a5hik/ng-sortable) which uses AngularJS
