I wrote last year about creating a "life work balance" favouring my life activities over my work activities. I have been trying to chase that ever since but I haven't even come close I don't think.. I struggle to keep the house tidy let alone getting out to do things I would like to do.. (such as surfing, or even just playing the guitar).


i'm using my own kanban board now, I have essentially bailed on the work kanban board. I will/should come back to it but it is overwhelming. There are so many issues there it is ridiculous. We have no split between our projects. Which is how I designed it.. I should have gone with separate boards. Oh well. Maybe in the future.

I am just rambling here and the reason for that is that I want just want to start writing. About what ever it is that is in my head at the moment. Right now it's a bunch of nothing. I really want to start the control systems course from MIT. An hour a day, four days a week? I can do that. Surely. I just have to commit. If I write all of my notes here then that'll help tremendously as well. Especially the maths. It is going to take a lot of effort to get back into maths like that.

But I want it. I want to improve myself. I know I can do this while at work but not as much as when I'm at home. I want to improve myself by having a good time and enjoying my life, getting fit and eating well. I'll get there. I'm committed to it.
