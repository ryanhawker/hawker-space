I have so many goals and I'm hitting none of them!

Here's a quick list of things I'd like to achieve/do. Preferably soon.

1. Getting surf fit again. Like proper surf fit. I'm doing a contest in one month so.. we will see where I'm at by then.
2. Get good at data analysis with Python. I can do this piece by piece... I just have to make myself do it.
3. Get good at web design. Working on that right here... Have to do more little projects and spice up this website a bit.
4. Get good at making Android apps. Literally downloaded Android studio and that's as far as I have got with this one... How do I prioritise this vs. the last two?! Which is more important to what I want to do as a job I suppose. Gah.
5. Eat really healthily. This should be so easy, but my mind is weak. If I can't handle this how can I handle the other stuff here! Gum on mate. 

That's definitely not everything but even those! Can I do all those? I don't know.

Ok so here's an idea. Maybe I do 30 minutes of 2 and 30 minutes of 3 EVERY morning of the week. From 5:30 to 6:30. Then I have my shower and go to work. Cool. That's.. 5 hours of getting better and coding/developing stuff each week which adds up to about 250 hours a year which means I will have my 10,000 hours in about 40 years. Thus by the time I am 60 years old, I'll be the fucking man.

In addition to this I need to get fit. I think I should start greasing the gap while I'm at work.. 5 push ups every 30 minutes? or something? ha. I don't know.. I think I should definitely start running a bit (read: walking quicky) and also going surfing as much as I possibly can. 

And the healthy eating well... I mean.. gummon. I just have to stop eating bad food. I am going to track my food intake with my fitness pal and hopefully that will be enough of a wake up call to stall my bad habits. We will see.
