After reading the book Microinteractions written by Dan Saffer I wanted to write down my thoughts and feelings on the subject to get it all clear with myself. Let's go.

## What is a microinteraction?

A microinteraction is any action that triggers a single event. Flick switch down, light turns on. Flick switch up, light turns off. Flicking a switch is a microinteraction. The questions isn't really why should we care about microinterations but rather **when** should we care about microinteractions. The answer is right from the beginning of a design. We want to be designing with details because a product is essentially just an accumulation of these details. If all of the details are brilliant, so too will be the product.
