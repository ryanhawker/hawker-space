My weird little website for learning things

How to get my environment working...

    apt-get install jekyll 
    jekyll serve

This literally gets the website served and watches for changes, auto-building when they're detected. This is pretty much all I want...

UPDATE: Needs ruby 2.2 or higher I think to work... use RVM for this or else all hell will break loose oh my lord
